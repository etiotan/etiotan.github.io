# Portfolio

**Synopsis**

A responsive minimalistic portfolio with some 3d flares. The entire website is responsive and will work on every device size. Although it looks the best on Chrome and Firefox.

**Challenges**

Creating a design I liked was a huge challenge, I ended up creating a full portfolio and scrapping it all. The only thing I really kept was the pyramid.

**Solutions**

What was really helpful was the fact that I broke down the entire project into very small components making it very easy to make changes. 

**Tools**

Gulp, Sass, Pug, jQuery, Javascript, Google Dev Tools, maybe more.

**Motivation**

A personal portfolio is a must have for any front-end dev. I want to be able to prove that I am able to code any design anyone provides me with.
